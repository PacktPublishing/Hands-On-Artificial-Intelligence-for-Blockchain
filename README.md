#### Services

Apart from the above software, you will also need to signup for the following services:

1. [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/premium/apikey/geolocation-apikey)

2. [MÃ³iBit](https://account.moibit.io/#/signup)

3. [Infura](https://infura.io/register)

4. Ethereum wallet with a wallet address and private key

5. Address of the location proof smart contract (You can use `0x79217e504A28ABCd30D2E90E2C99334FA2e9Fb19` on Kovan)

#### Justfile

Once you have the credentials for all the above 5 services, update your local justfile:
```yaml
export GMAPS_API_KEY := "?"
export MOIBIT_API_KEY := "?"
export MOIBIT_API_SECRET := "?"
export WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID := "?"
export PROOF_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS := "?"
export WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY := "?"
export WALLET_ADDRESS := "?"

run-client:
    python iot-client-code/python/main.py

run-web:
    cd frontend-tracking-dashboard && node index.js

run-server:
    python backend-contact-tracing/server.py

install-dependencies:
    pip install --user -r requirements.txt
    cd frontend-tracking-dashboard && npm install
```

#### Installing python and npm libaries

If you have updated your Jusfile successfully, you need to run the following command to automatically install all the python and Javasript dependencies:

```sh
just install-dependencies
```

Make sure that you are running this command in the same directory where justfile exists.

### Running the app

#### Running the IoT sensor client application

```sh
just run-client
```

#### Running the Contact tracing backend API

```sh
just run-server
```

#### Running the Web dashboard server

```sh
just run-web
```
